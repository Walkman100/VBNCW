# Mono Tests
Test files used to check if you have Mono and Mono-VB installed correctly.

See [mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/mono-basics](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/mono-basics/)

Once you have cloned this repo, you can `cd` into this folder and run `./run-tests.sh` to run all the tests - the script will warn you and stop if there are errors. Note that the second last test requires opening a provided URL in a browser, and the last test doesn't exit when you close it's window, you'll have to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.
